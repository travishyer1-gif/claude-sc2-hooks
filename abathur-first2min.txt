Tell me about this Leviathan.
It is the organism from which you command the swarm, and this is its nerve center.
And it can take me to any world I wish?
Of course, my queen, but our numbers are few.
Before conquering other worlds, you may wish to reclaim your forces here on Calder.
Leave the strategy to me.
Now, what else can I do on this Leviathan?
You can evolve and upgrade your swarm in the evolution pit.
The creature, abithor, can help you.
What are you?
Abithor, evolve swarm, spin strands, and sequences.
Served overmind, then served queen of blades.
Now, serve you.
I am the queen of blades.
Hmm, different.
Examining genetic strands, queen of blades was efficient.
Ancient, sir, qualities.
Minor, terrain, influence.
You, infected with more terrain matter.
Grasperling, poorly designed, can improve.
We'll give it back, better.
Don't touch me.
Only focus is evolving the swarm.
Seek perfection in all things.
Work in evolution pit.
Can review my work here.
Many benefits to evolving swarm.
Start with circling.
Organism can be upgraded.
Three distinct mutations available.
Once chosen, we'll activate sequences within creature.
